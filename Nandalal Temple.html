		      <p class="history" style="text-align:justify">Nandalal temple was built in the second half of seventeenth century. It is a 'Eka-Ratna' style temple made of rust coloured laterite. The temple constructed on a low platform has a square base and Bengali ‘chala’ type curved roof. A single tower or 'sikhara' is resting on the roof. Structurally it has similarity with Radha Madhav temple. That means there are covered porches on all four sides around the innermost sanctuary where the idol is kept, and there are three arched openings at each of the two adjacent sides of the temple. Very little decoration or bas-relief is still present on its walls. Once there was stone carving of different patterns and figures covered with stucco work on the wall, which is mostly washed out.
