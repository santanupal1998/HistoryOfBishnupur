						    <p class="history"  style="text-align:justify">The word Terracotta is derived from the Latin word 'Terra' meaning 'earth' or 'soil' and 'Cotta' meaning burning. That is, the word terracotta means terra cotta. So terracotta art refers to terracotta artwork. History says that this industry is not an industry that developed suddenly. This art has its roots deep rooted in the beginning of human civilization. An industry that once began its journey in prehistoric times with the manufacture of everyday pottery, has evolved into a multifaceted world-conquering industry today. The history of artistic pursuits as well as artistic spirit is hidden in the artistic splendor of terracotta. According to Chittaranjan Dasgupta, the author of the book 'Bishnupur Temple Terracotta', the world's oldest international art world has been built around terracotta - the history of the origin and development of Indian sculpture is hidden in the world of terracotta. It was in this world that the influence of extra-Indian influence was first felt in the art world of ancient India -- Sumerian influence in the Indus civilization, West-Asian influence in the pre-Mauryan period, Greco-Persian influence in the Mauryan period, West-Asian influence in the Sunga period and Greek influence in the Kushana period.</p>
    <p class="history"  style="text-align:justify">Not only India -- this art was widespread in China, Egypt, Crete, Cyprus, Sumeria-Babylon, Greece, Italy and various regions of South America. Many prehistoric terracotta figurines have been found in the Deccan region of India. Mohenjo-daro has been found with high-quality statues, animals and toys. The terracotta statues found at places like Taxila, Mathura, Patna, Vita, Buxar etc. are postulated by archaeologists to be of the later period of the Indus Civilization. It is probably from the Gupta period, which marks the golden age of Indian culture, that terracotta objects were used for decoration, social festivals and temples.</p> 
   <p class="history"  style="text-align:justify">
A number of terracotta objects have been found in Assam, Bengal and Kashmir in the 8th century AD. A large number of rural folk art and temple decoration plates dating from the 10th-11th century AD are found at Paharpur in Rajshahi district of Bangladesh. Paharpur-like folk art plaques have been discovered in Assam and Mainamati and Savar in Bangladesh. Built in the 10th-11th century AD, the famous Siddheshwar Shiva temple at Bahulara village near Bishnupur, about 63 feet high, houses a magnificent collection of terracotta art sculptures. Established in contemporary times, the dilapidated temple at Baliara village in Bankura also bears witness to the splendor of the terracotta industry. After the Turkish conquest, the enthusiasm for building temples in Bengal waned and there was no trace of the terracotta industry for about 500 years. The second phase of Muslim rule saw the rise of terracotta art in Muslim architecture during the period 1400-1600 AD, the best examples of which are found at Gaur, Pandua and Adina in Malda district.</p>
    <p class="history"  style="text-align:justify">After the initiation of Veer Hambir into Vaishnava religion by Srinivasa Acharya at the end of the sixteenth century of Christ, the strong religious atmosphere of Krishna-Vishnu worship was created in Bishnupur i.e. Mallaraj, as a fruitful result, numerous temples were built in Mallaraj in seventeenth-eighteenth century. They are mainly made of limestone or brick. Sometimes spiders are made of stone and brick. Stone temples predominate in carving, while brick temples use molded terracotta plaques. Ramayana, Mahabharata, Puranas as well as contemporary social paintings, domestic scenes of Bengali interiors, war scenes, hunting scenes, boating, folk culture and even Firingi life scenes have been placed as motifs in terracotta in the decoration of the temples. Bishnupur's Shyamray Temple (founded in 1643 AD), Jorbangla Temple (founded in 1655 AD), Radhabinod Temple (founded in 1659 AD), Madanmohan Temple (founded in 1694 AD), Sridhar Temple, etc., have a wonderful collection of terracotta art.</p>
    <p class="history"  style="text-align:justify">Clay is prepared by mixing straw, chaff etc. with sticky clay like laterite. Terracotta sculptures are made from that clay by making statues, scenes and drying it in the sun. A figure is first made of mud and then dried in the sun and then hardened by fire. Terracotta art is the presentation of works of art on clay in this manner. At present, Bishnupur town is home to a rich collection of terracotta artefacts. These include -- elephants-horses, Durga idols, folklore images etc. are notable. The terracotta art and the temples rich in this art have brought international recognition to Bishnupur, the art of Bengal This terracotta industry has become one of the symbols of Bengal's culture in the court of the world.</p>
