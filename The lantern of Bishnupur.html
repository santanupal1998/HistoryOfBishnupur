The historic city of Bishnupur is attractive enough to the middle class Bengali visitor. Many tourists visit Bishnupur during the season. There are also several things to buy. From silk-baluchari to Bengali bride's life-size conch shell, love gift to beautiful enamelled conch ring, Panchmura horse and even Dasavatar playing cards. And in addition to all these, a household item of daily use is available here—that is the lantern. This is where it is made, known as Bishnupuri Lanthan.

It is not possible to say exactly when the use of lanterns started. But Sri Shankar Garai of Bishnupur was telling us the story of this lantern. Three men hold their lantern business. His grandfather Raicharan Garai is the creator of this lantern. At that time, the caste business of Garaid (Kalu) was Ghani. The introduction of oil mills a hundred years ago led to a decline in the ox-drawn mining business. Garaira are looking for alternative means of earning money. The opportunity came. At that time, railway traffic has just started over Bishnupur. A Marwari named Onkarmal opened a kerosene depot near Bishnupur station. Raicharan started using the empty tins from this depot to make lanterns. The appearance of this lantern was not so bright then; Most of them could not even afford to buy a Bilati Hurricane. of people So this lantern of 6 paise price then became the main lighting item for the middle class people in the towns and villages.

The days have changed, the cities and many villages have been illuminated with various types of modern electric lights. Yet the tradition continues. The demand for this lantern made in Bishnupur is still undiminished. Now its raw material is brought from Kolkata. Generally, the discarded tin from tin factories is used to make these lanterns. Thirty-four gauge white tin is used for this purpose. Glass is cut to size and fitted and paint is used to weld the lantern parts.

According to the size of the factory, the workers work, but it is completely a cottage industry. It can be produced by just one artisan without anyone's help. But in that case the production is a little less. All work is done by hand, none by machine. Lately, to save time, these two parts, burner and cap, are made by punching the press machine by placing an order in Calcuttabeing done Once its price was 6 paise in Bishnupur, its price was 18 taka in Accra market. An eight taka lantern costs about five and a half taka in raw material and a five taka lamp costs close to three taka for a smaller one. However, many innovations have come in its structure than before.
</p>
    <p class="history"  style="text-align:justify">

There are about fifty lantern shops all over Bishnupur town; Shops are not showcases, racks, factories are shops—sold where they are made. About two hundred people are making a living from this cottage industry. Factory owners are also workers and are directly involved in production work. It was reported that a factory employing seven workers produced up to six dozen lanterns a day. However, Shankar Garai, Shasthi Lohar, Madan Das, Dhananjaya Karmakar etc. said that if they try to increase the income, maybe two to five more lanterns can be made a day, but instead of doing that, they try their best to maintain the quality of the product. Lantern making goes on almost throughout the year. However, during the three months from Bhadra to Kartik, its production is slightly disrupted, and the market is depressed. When Aghran comes, when new paddy comes from house to house, its market goes strong again.

It is running in all districts of West Bengal. It can be exported to other states of India as well. Wholesalers from Baleshwar, Bilaspur, Munger, Kashi, Mathura, Vrindavan and different areas of Madhya Pradesh regularly come to Bishnupur to buy goods. Mango growers in Malda Murshidabad also buy dozens of lanterns. They hang burning lanterns on the mango tree to protect our sadha's mangoes from night thieves.

This item is also gaining in popularity in modern poojamandaps of great grandeur. Many people order large lanterns for use on Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Chabishpahar. Many city dwellers also keep one at home to provide a proxy for load shedding. Again, the expensive South Indian Parihita Sudarshana tourist might collect one from Bishnupur Road to decorate the living room of a luxurious modern householder.

But that's out of the question. Anyone who has seen the village of Bankura up close knows how cruelly this lantern of Bishnupur survives in the midst of the dazzling flashes of electric light. Be it in windless hot summers, rainy monsoons and bone-shaking winters, this lantern is still the mainstay of the rural people at home and outside, the practical value of which is surprising in today's world - only ten paise. In fact, along with the dignity of life, like the hand of the runner, the small lantern in the hands of the village here has been burning from some past time—that burning has no end."
